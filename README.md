# Overview

These modules are adapted from 'The Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide' and
serve to display my progress through the guide.
After completing this guide, I will be hopefully be continuing
my learning of systems-level programming and Linux by creating my own driver software.

## Gained knowledge

Through this guide I have learned or further improved my skills in various technologies and programs, such as:

- How to create linux kernel modules
- Linux CLI (Ubuntu); I chose to omit using a GUI in favour of the CLI to deepen my understanding and develop skills in CLI environments.  
- vim
- (a deeper understanding of) headers and C
- Makefiles
- kernels, modules and drivers
